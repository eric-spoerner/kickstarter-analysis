# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis was conducted in order to determine the optimal timing and funding goals for Kickstarter projects related to the theater in the US and Great Britain.  Data is comprised of kickstarter data from more than 4,000 kickstarter campaigns compiled from 2009 through 2017.  Analysis was conducted using MIcrosoft Excel.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Data set was segmented by month (irrespective of year), as well as three of the four kickstarter statuses: lsuccessful, failed, canceled (live was not included).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

ANalysis was conducted using successful, failed, canceled, and were segmented into bands of data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Normalizing data?  Identifying outliers?  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May is the most successful month for launching kickstarters, with 111 successful kickstarters, followed by June.  Early spring and late summer is the most successful campaign season.

Seasonality has less of an impact on failures.  December is the least successful month for kickstarter campaigns, presumably due to crowding out from holiday season spending.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Generally speaking, the smaller a kickstarter campaign is, the more likely it is to succeed.  Kickstarters with fudning goals less than $10,000 are the only ones with a higher than 50% success rate, with campaigns less than $,1000 having a 71% success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Reasons for cancellation are not listed, which could have a material impact on this analysis. 

Successful kickstarters have no sense of subsequent outcome?



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Something about percentage funded?
